#' This dataset was **manually compiled** by the package author based on values
#' reported in Zacher et al. (2019):
#' *Application of a new methodology and R package reveals a high burden of
#' healthcare-associated infections in Germany compared to the EU/EEA, 2011-2012.*
#'
#' It is not derived from raw data. Instead, it summarises key published indicators
#' (cases, deaths, DALYs) for communication and visualisation purposes within the app.
