# haiInsight

Tools and an interactive app to explore **healthcare-associated
infection (HAI)** data derived from the BHAI package.  
This package was developed as part of *ETC5523: Communicating with Data*
at Monash University.

## `haiInsight` provides simple, reproducible tools for summarising and visualising infection data, including an interactive Shiny dashboard to explore infection trends by **infection type**, **age group**, and **sex**.

## Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub:

``` r
# Install dependencies if needed
install.packages(c("devtools", "shiny", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "bslib", "kableExtra"))

# Install from GitHub
devtools::install_github("ETC5523-2025/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-jyovika")
```

Load the package:

``` r
library(haiInsight)
```

## Example usage

``` r
# Load included data
data("hai_data_clean")

# Summarise total cases by infection type
summarise_hai(hai_data_clean, by = "Infection_Type")

# Visualise totals by age group
plot_hai_totals(hai_data_clean, by = "Age_Group")
```

These functions let you quickly compare infection distributions across
groups - with built-in styling and optional proportional views.

## Launch the Shiny app

``` r
run_hai_app()
```

This opens an interactive interface to:

- Filter by **infection type** and **sex**

- View totals by **infection type**, **age group**, or **sex**

- Display both plots and summary tables with clear, styled output
